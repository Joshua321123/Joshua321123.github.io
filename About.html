<h1>Joshua Sarmiento</h1>
<h5>Gamer</h5>
<p>I'm Joshua P. Sarmiento, I play games because winning and losing does not have meaning, because some people win by losing and some lose by winning. Playing games bring people together, it is the competition among peers that adds adrenaline. After a success in a game, we are more likely to set an ambitious goal for ourselves, even outside of gaming. </p>
<p>So just play, not because it’s good for you, but because it’s fun. That’s more than enough.</p>
